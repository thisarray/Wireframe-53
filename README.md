[Run the JavaScript port of the side-scrolling shoot-'em-up in your browser.](https://thisarray.github.io/Wireframe-53/SideScrollingShootEmUp/)

If you are interested in creating your own level, I also ported the utilities:

- [Create Foreground](https://thisarray.github.io/Wireframe-53/SideScrollingShootEmUp/04_CreateForeground.html)
- [Create Path](https://thisarray.github.io/Wireframe-53/SideScrollingShootEmUp/15_CreatePath.html)
- [Create Start Enemies](https://thisarray.github.io/Wireframe-53/SideScrollingShootEmUp/21_CreateStartEnemies.html)

Note the level is specified in JSON in the JavaScript port with the name of the foreground or the enemy instead of a numeric index.
This makes the level description self-contained.
In addition, the JavaScript port does not use polygons.
